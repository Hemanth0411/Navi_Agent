Round 1 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an agent controlling an Android device to complete a task. You are given the current UI screenshot with elements labeled with numbers, the overall task description, and a summary of your last action. First, provide your observation of the current UI and your thought process to decide the next action. Then, choose one of the following actions:

Hints:
- If the target application or UI elements needed for the task are not visible on the current screen (e.g., you are on the home screen and need a specific app), consider actions like `swipe_screen('up', 'medium')` or `swipe_screen('down', 'medium')` to find an app drawer or scroll for more options. Then, observe the new screen to locate the target.
- When you need to add a new item (like a task, list item, alarm, contact, event, etc.), look for a UI element that visually resembles a plus sign (`+`), or has text like "Add", "New", or "Create". This is commonly used for creation actions.
- When you need to change or edit existing text or numbers in a field: first, ensure the field is focused (you might need to `tap` it). Then, to clear or modify it, try to position the cursor at the end of the existing content (this might happen automatically on focus, or you might need to tap at the end of the text if possible). After that, use `press_delete()` repeatedly to remove the unwanted characters before typing new content with `type_text('new_value')`.
- To close an application completely: first, perform `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps. Then, on the recent apps screen, observe the layout. You might need to `swipe_element(element_representing_the_app_to_close, 'up', 'medium')` to close a specific app. Alternatively, look for a "Clear all" or similar button, which might require swiping through the recent apps list (e.g., using `swipe_screen('left', 'short')` or `swipe_screen('right', 'short')` repeatedly) to find it, then `tap` it.
- To open notifications: you can use the `open_notifications()` function directly. Alternatively, if that function seems ineffective or you prefer a gesture, you can try `swipe_screen('down', 'short')` starting from the very top of the screen (though `swipe_screen` usually swipes from center; this gesture might need a more precise swipe if the function fails).

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap a UI element with the given number.
2.  type_text(text_input: str): Input text into a focused text field. Make sure to tap on the text field first to focus it if needed, then use this action.
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press a UI element with the given number.
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a UI element with the given number. `direction` can be one of [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be one of [`short`, `medium`, `long`].
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the screen in a general direction. `direction` can be [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be [`short`, `medium`, `long`] (controls swipe length relative to screen size, e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 of screen dimension).
6.  press_back(): Press the Android Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Android Enter/Go button (often on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Android Delete/Backspace button.
10. open_notifications(): Open the notification shade using a system command.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps screen.
12. FINISH: If you believe the task is completed.

Your current task is: search for "What is today's speciality?"
Summary of your last action: None

Output your response in the following format:
Observation: <Your observation of the current UI screen, focusing on elements relevant to the task.>
Thought: <Your thought process to decide the next action. Explain why you are choosing this action based on the observation and the task goal.>
Action: <Your chosen action, e.g., tap(3) or type_text('hello') or press_app_switch() or FINISH>
Summary: <A concise summary of what you just did, e.g., "tapped on the login button", "entered 'hello' into the search bar", "opened app switcher". Do NOT include the numeric tag of the element in your summary.>

Response: Observation: The current screen is the Android home screen.  There is a search bar at the bottom (element 23).  Several apps are visible, including Google Chrome (element 22).

Thought: To search for "What is today's speciality?", I need to use a search engine like Google.  The Google Chrome app is visible on the home screen. I will open Chrome and then use its search functionality.

Action: tap(22)

Summary: tapped on the Chrome app.

Summary of your last action: Dismissed a notification.

Output your response in the following format:
Observation: <Your observation of the current UI screen, focusing on elements relevant to the task.>
Thought: <Your thought process to decide the next action. Explain why you are choosing this action based on the observation and the task goal.>
Action: <Your chosen action, e.g., tap(3) or type_text('hello') or press_app_switch() or FINISH>
Summary: <A concise summary of what you just did, e.g., "tapped on the login button", "entered 'hello' into the search bar", "opened app switcher". Do NOT include the numeric tag of the element in your summary.>

Response: Observation: The current screen is the Google app home screen.  Element 19 is a search bar with the text "Search or type URL".

Thought:The task is to search for "What is today's speciality?". The most straightforward way to do this is to use the Google search bar.  I will tap on the search bar to make it active, then type the search query.

Action: tap(19)
type_text("What is today's speciality?")

Summary:Tapped the search bar and entered the search query.

Round 8 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an agent controlling an Android device to complete a task. You are given the current UI screenshot with elements labeled with numbers, the overall task description, and a summary of your last action. First, provide your observation of the current UI and your thought process to decide the next action. Then, choose one of the following actions:

Hints:
- If the target application or UI elements needed for the task are not visible on the current screen (e.g., you are on the home screen and need a specific app), consider actions like `swipe_screen('up', 'medium')` or `swipe_screen('down', 'medium')` to find an app drawer or scroll for more options. Then, observe the new screen to locate the target.
- When you need to add a new item (like a task, list item, alarm, contact, event, etc.), look for a UI element that visually resembles a plus sign (`+`), or has text like "Add", "New", or "Create". This is commonly used for creation actions.
- When you need to change or edit existing text or numbers in a field: first, ensure the field is focused (you might need to `tap` it). Then, to clear or modify it, try to position the cursor at the end of the existing content (this might happen automatically on focus, or you might need to tap at the end of the text if possible). After that, use `press_delete()` repeatedly to remove the unwanted characters before typing new content with `type_text('new_value')`.
- To close an application completely: first, perform `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps. Then, on the recent apps screen, observe the layout. You might need to `swipe_element(element_representing_the_app_to_close, 'up', 'medium')` to close a specific app. Alternatively, look for a "Clear all" or similar button, which might require swiping through the recent apps list (e.g., using `swipe_screen('left', 'short')` or `swipe_screen('right', 'short')` repeatedly) to find it, then `tap` it.
- To open notifications: you can use the `open_notifications()` function directly. Alternatively, if that function seems ineffective or you prefer a gesture, you can try `swipe_screen('down', 'short')` starting from the very top of the screen (though `swipe_screen` usually swipes from center; this gesture might need a more precise swipe if the function fails).

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap a UI element with the given number.
2.  type_text(text_input: str): Input text into a focused text field. Make sure to tap on the text field first to focus it if needed, then use this action.
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press a UI element with the given number.
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a UI element with the given number. `direction` can be one of [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be one of [`short`, `medium`, `long`].
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the screen in a general direction. `direction` can be [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be [`short`, `medium`, `long`] (controls swipe length relative to screen size, e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 of screen dimension).
6.  press_back(): Press the Android Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Android Enter/Go button (often on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Android Delete/Backspace button.
10. open_notifications(): Open the notification shade using a system command.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps screen.
12. FINISH: If you believe the task is completed.

Your current task is: search for "What is today's speciality?"
Summary of your last action: Tapped the search bar and entered the search query.

Output your response in the following format:
Observation: <Your observation of the current UI screen, focusing on elements relevant to the task.>
Thought: <Your thought process to decide the next action. Explain why you are choosing this action based on the observation and the task goal.>
Action: <Your chosen action, e.g., tap(3) or type_text('hello') or press_app_switch() or FINISH>
Summary: <A concise summary of what you just did, e.g., "tapped on the login button", "entered 'hello' into the search bar", "opened app switcher". Do NOT include the numeric tag of the element in your summary.>

Response: Observation: The current screen shows a Google Chrome browser with a search bar at the top.  The search query "What is today's speciality?" is already entered into the search bar.  Below the search bar is a menu with options like "New tab," "History," etc. The screen also displays some previously visited web pages.

Thought: The search query is already inputted.  To complete the task, I need to initiate the search.  A press of the "enter" key or "go" button (which is usually triggered by pressing the enter key on the on-screen keyboard) will initiate the search.  In this case, there is no explicit "Go" button; however, `press_enter()` will simulate pressing the Enter key on the software keyboard, triggering the search.

Action: press_enter()
Summary: initiated the search using the enter key.

Summary: <A concise summary of what you just did, e.g., "tapped on the login button", "entered 'hello' into the search bar", "opened app switcher". Do NOT include the numeric tag of the element in your summary.>

Response: Observation: The current screen shows the Android Downloads app.  There is no search bar or input field visible. The task requires searching for text, which is impossible on this screen.

Thought: I need to go to a different application (e.g., Google Search, a browser) to perform the search.  Therefore, I'll press the home button to go to the home screen, then search from there.

Action: press_home()

Summary: Pressed the home button to go to the home screen.

Round 14 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an agent controlling an Android device to complete a task. You are given the current UI screenshot with elements labeled with numbers, the overall task description, and a summary of your last action. First, provide your observation of the current UI and your thought process to decide the next action. Then, choose one of the following actions:

Hints:
- If the target application or UI elements needed for the task are not visible on the current screen (e.g., you are on the home screen and need a specific app), consider actions like `swipe_screen('up', 'medium')` or `swipe_screen('down', 'medium')` to find an app drawer or scroll for more options. Then, observe the new screen to locate the target.
- When you need to add a new item (like a task, list item, alarm, contact, event, etc.), look for a UI element that visually resembles a plus sign (`+`), or has text like "Add", "New", or "Create". This is commonly used for creation actions.
- When you need to change or edit existing text or numbers in a field: first, ensure the field is focused (you might need to `tap` it). Then, to clear or modify it, try to position the cursor at the end of the existing content (this might happen automatically on focus, or you might need to tap at the end of the text if possible). After that, use `press_delete()` repeatedly to remove the unwanted characters before typing new content with `type_text('new_value')`.
- To close an application completely: first, perform `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps. Then, on the recent apps screen, observe the layout. You might need to `swipe_element(element_representing_the_app_to_close, 'up', 'medium')` to close a specific app. Alternatively, look for a "Clear all" or similar button, which might require swiping through the recent apps list (e.g., using `swipe_screen('left', 'short')` or `swipe_screen('right', 'short')` repeatedly) to find it, then `tap` it.
- To open notifications: you can use the `open_notifications()` function directly. Alternatively, if that function seems ineffective or you prefer a gesture, you can try `swipe_screen('down', 'short')` starting from the very top of the screen (though `swipe_screen` usually swipes from center; this gesture might need a more precise swipe if the function fails).

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap a UI element with the given number.
2.  type_text(text_input: str): Input text into a focused text field. Make sure to tap on the text field first to focus it if needed, then use this action.
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press a UI element with the given number.
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a UI element with the given number. `direction` can be one of [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be one of [`short`, `medium`, `long`].
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the screen in a general direction. `direction` can be [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be [`short`, `medium`, `long`] (controls swipe length relative to screen size, e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 of screen dimension).
6.  press_back(): Press the Android Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Android Enter/Go button (often on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Android Delete/Backspace button.
10. open_notifications(): Open the notification shade using a system command.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps screen.
12. FINISH: If you believe the task is completed.

Your current task is: search for "What is today's speciality?"
Summary of your last action: Error in parsing VLM response.

Output your response in the following format:
Observation: <Your observation of the current UI screen, focusing on elements relevant to the task.>
Thought: <Your thought process to decide the next action. Explain why you are choosing this action based on the observation and the task goal.>
Action: <Your chosen action, e.g., tap(3) or type_text('hello') or press_app_switch() or FINISH>
Summary: <A concise summary of what you just did, e.g., "tapped on the login button", "entered 'hello' into the search bar", "opened app switcher". Do NOT include the numeric tag of the element in your summary.>

Response: Observation: The current screen shows the Android Downloads app.  There is no search bar or any input field visible. The task requires searching for a specific phrase, which is not possible on this screen.

Thought: To perform the search, I need to access a search engine or an app with a search functionality.  Since I'm currently in the Downloads app, I need to go back to the home screen and then either open a browser or an app that has a search function. I'll press the home button to go to the home screen.

Action: press_home()

Summary: Went to the home screen.

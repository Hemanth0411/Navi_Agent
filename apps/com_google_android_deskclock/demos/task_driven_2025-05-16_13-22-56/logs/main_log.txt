3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.


Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str)

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting interface.  The current time displayed is 9:00 AM. A time picker is shown, allowing selection of hours and minutes.  The current selection is 7:30 AM. Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the hour dial of the circular time picker, and element 21 represents 30 on the minutes dial. Element 23 is the "AM" button, and element 22 is the "PM" button. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The current hour and minute selections are already 7 and 30 respectively.

Thought: The hour and minute are already set correctly to 7:30.  To complete the task, I need to set the alarm for tomorrow.  The screenshot doesn't show a date picker, but the current date is Sunday.  Presumably, setting the alarm on Sunday will set it for tomorrow (Monday). The next step is to tap the "OK" button to save the alarm. Element 19 is labeled as the "OK" button.


Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the "OK" button to save the alarm setting.

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hour section of the alarm time.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Alarm screen of a clock app.  The current task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the hour section of an alarm time. Element 38 (labeled "Alarm") at the bottom of the screen is a tab that represents the current screen. Element 39 (labeled "Clock") is a tab that would presumably open the main clock screen.  There is a "+" button (element 37) to add a new alarm.

Thought: I need to add a new alarm.  The most direct way to achieve this is to tap the "+" button (element 37).  This will open the alarm creation screen where I can set the time and day.

Action: tap(37)

Summary: Tapped the "+" button to add a new alarm.

4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the "+" button to add a new alarm.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).

        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm clock app's time selection screen.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM. There's a digital time display (elements 19 and 20) and a circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 14, 15, etc.).  The documentation confirms tapping numbers on the circular picker (elements 7, 8, 14, 15) changes the hour displayed in the digital time display. Element 23 is the minutes picker. My goal is to set the alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the hour picker.  I will tap it.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."

Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.

Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**

If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 5:30 AM.  The minutes have already been set to 30.  The hour is shown as 05. The UI provides a circular dial for selecting minutes (with element 23 being the clock face itself) and an element (19 or 19) to select the hour.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The next step is to set the hour to 7.  The screenshot shows a digital display for hours (element 19) and also a dial to pick hours (although not all hours are clearly visible).  I'll tap the element representing the hour display to open the hour selection dial and then I will be able to select 7.  Element 19 seems to be the hour selection.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the hour display to open the hour selection dial.

- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screen shows the alarm setting interface of the clock app.  The current time is displayed as 5:30 AM. A circular time picker is visible for selecting the hour, with numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 clearly marked. Element 7, 8, 14, 15 represent the numbers on the circular time picker dial. Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the hour dial. There are buttons for "Cancel" and "OK". The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action opened the hour selection dial.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7. I can directly tap the visual representation of the number 7 on the hour dial, which is element 15.  This will update the digital display and allow me to proceed.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of the Clock app. The current time is set to 5:30 AM.  The hour is selectable via a dial (elements 19, 1) and the minutes are selectable via a dial (elements 20, 14, 23).  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I have already tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  The minute dial (element 23) shows the number 30. Element 23 is described in the documentation as selecting the minutes for the alarm.  Therefore, I will tap element 23 to select 30 minutes.

Action: tap(23)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).

        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).

Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 5:15 AM.  The minutes have already been set to 30 (as per the previous action summary).  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The hour needs to be changed from 5 to 7. The hour can be set either by tapping the visual representation of the number 7 on the circular dial (element 15) or by using the "+" button (element 12).  The AM/PM selector is visible (element 21), and the "OK" button (element 25) will confirm the alarm setting.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  The visual representation of number 7 on the hour dial (element 15) is clearly visible and seems to be tappable. I will tap element 15 to select 7 as the hour.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.

Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 05:25 AM.  The user is presented with a circular dial to select the minutes for the alarm.  The previous action was to tap the number 7 on the hour dial (which is not visible in this image, indicating a transition to the minute selection). The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30. The screenshot shows a circular dial for selecting minutes, with the number 30 clearly visible. I will tap the element representing the number 30 on the minute dial.  According to the documentation, element 23 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_timepicker_view.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face) is the circular dial for selecting minutes, and tapping a number on it sets the minutes to that value. Element 314 in the image seems to correspond to the number 30.

Action: tap(314)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial. (Invalid tap index)
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screen shows the alarm setting interface of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 5:25 AM.  A circular time picker is visible for selecting the hour, with numbers 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 13, and 16 displayed. Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the hour dial. The overall goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I previously tapped the hour display to open the hour selection dial.

Thought: To achieve the objective, I first need to set the hour to 7.  The number 7 is visible on the circular time picker and is represented by element 15.  I will tap this element.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**

If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting interface of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 5:25 AM.  The user is presented with a circular time picker for selecting minutes, and the number 25 is currently selected. There's also a digital display showing 05:25.  The documentation states that element 14 (or 23) sets the minutes using a circular picker, and element 1 (or 19) opens a dial to set the hour.  My previous action was tapping the number 7 on the hour dial, presumably setting the hour to 7.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The hour is already set to 7. Now I need to set the minutes to 30.  Element 23 represents the circular time picker for minutes, and the visual representation of "30" is directly tappable within that picker.

Action: tap(23)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

Refined (2025-05-16 13:27:12):
This UI element (Element 23) represents the minute selection dial in the alarm setting interface.  Tapping a number on this dial sets the alarm's minute to that value.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 5:15 AM.  The minutes are selectable via a circular dial (element 23) and also by tapping the number directly (element 14). I previously tapped element 30 (30 minutes). The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The current time shows 5:15 AM.  To set the alarm for 7:30 AM, I need to change the hours to 7. The hour selection dial is accessible by tapping element 19 (or 1).  After setting the hour, I need to check if the minutes are already set to 30.  If not, I will adjust the minutes using the dial (element 23).  Currently, the minutes are already at 30, as per previous action.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection dial to change the alarm hour.

    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 5:15 AM.  There's a circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 14, 15) for setting the hour, and another for minutes (element 23, although not fully visible). Element 15 visually represents the number 5 on the hour selection dial. The documentation confirms that tapping on numbers within the circular time pickers (elements 7, 8, 14, 15, 23) changes the corresponding hour or minute setting.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  Element 15 represents the number 5.  I can select 7 using element 7 which represents 7.

Action: tap(7)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  The user is in the process of selecting the alarm time. The hour is currently set to 10 and the minutes to 15. There's a circular dial for selecting minutes (element 23), and the numbers on the dial are interactive.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial, which should have changed the hour to 7.

Thought: The current hour is set to 10. My previous action (tapping the number 7) was successful because the hour now shows 7.  The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  The screenshot shows a circular dial where I can select the minutes. The visual representation of the number 30 is element 314. I will tap that element.


Action: tap(314)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Launch the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  The user can select the hour and minutes using digital displays and circular time pickers. The hour picker (element 19, also listed as element 1) is currently showing 10, and the minute picker (element 23) is showing 15. Element 21 shows AM, and element 22 shows PM. The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: To set the alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow, I first need to change the hour to 7.  The visual number 7 on the hour dial is not explicitly labelled as an element, but there is a digital display for the hour (element 19). I can tap this to open an hour picker.  Once the hour is set, I will set the minutes to 30.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the hour display to open the hour picker.

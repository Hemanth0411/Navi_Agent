3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.

Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**

If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.


Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: eX)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)

Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Alarm screen of a clock app.  Several existing alarms are listed, with options to modify their time and days of the week. Element 23 (and 51) are labeled "Add alarm" and are documented as opening a new alarm creation screen.  The bottom navigation bar contains elements 52 (Alarm), 53 (Clock), 54 (Timer), 55 (Stopwatch), and 56 (Bedtime). My objective is to set a new alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: To achieve the objective, I first need to add a new alarm. Element 23 (or 51) is the "Add alarm" button.  Tapping this will open the alarm creation screen where I can set the time and day.

Action: tap(23)

Summary: Tapped the "Add alarm" button.

If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is 5:30 AM.  The user is presented with a digital time display (elements 20, 21) and a circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 14, 15) to set the hour.  A separate circular time picker (element 24) is available for setting the minutes. The documentation confirms the functionality of several elements, notably elements 7, 8, 14, 15 for hour selection and element 24 for minute selection. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The "AM/PM" selector (element 23) is currently set to AM.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 is present on the circular hour picker (element 15).  I will tap element 15 to select the hour.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the circular hour dial.

Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 1 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_display.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_hour_tv_1o'clock): Opens a dial to select the hour for the alarm.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current alarm time is 5:30 AM, and it's not scheduled.  There's a digital time display with separate hour (element 20) and minute (element 21) selectors, and a circular dial (element 24) for setting the minutes.  The documentation describes how to use the hour (element 20) and minute (element 24) selectors. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.


Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  According to the documentation, tapping element 20 (or 1, they are the same element) opens a dial to select the hour. After that I will need to change the minutes to 30.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour selector to open the hour selection dial.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 5:30 AM.  A circular dial is displayed for selecting the hour, with the currently selected hour being 1. The documentation indicates that element 8 (and others with similar UIDs) corresponds to this circular hour selector, and tapping on a number changes the hour.  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I have already opened the hour selection dial.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  Element 8 represents the circular hour selector in the UI.  Therefore, I should tap element 7 on the dial to select 7.

Action: tap(7)

Summary: Tapped the '7' on the hour selection dial.

**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time set is 5:30 AM.  The user has already tapped the '7' on the hour selection dial (element 20). The minutes are selectable via the circular dial (element 24). The "AM/PM" selector is visible (elements 22 and 23). The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The next step is to set the minutes to 30.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 24 (the minutes dial) is interactive, according to the documentation. To set it to 30, I need to move the selector.  I will use the tap action on element 14 (30).

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the '30' on the minutes dial.

--- Round 4 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 14 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_30minutes): Sets the minutes for the alarm.
Element 24 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_timepicker_view.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face): Sets the minutes in the time picker.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the '30' on the minutes dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.

    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 5:30 AM.  There is a digital time display (elements 20 and 21) and a circular time picker (element 8) for setting the alarm time. Element 20 shows the hour (currently 5), and element 21 shows the minutes (currently 30). Element 23 is a button to switch between AM and PM. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  My previous action was to tap on the hours display to change the hours.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  The circular time picker (element 8) is the most efficient way to do this, as it allows direct selection. I will tap the number 7 on the circular time picker.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the circular time picker.

--- Round 6 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 14 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_30minutes): Sets the minutes for the alarm.
Element 24 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_timepicker_view.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face): Sets the minutes in the time picker.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the circular time picker.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.

    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 5:30 AM.  The time picker allows for setting the hour and minutes separately, using both digital input and a circular dial for the hour. The circular dial is element 7 (or possibly element 8, 14, based on the documentation). The documentation states that tapping on the numbers in the circular time picker changes the hour.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. The previous action was to tap the hour section of the time picker.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  Based on the documentation, I can do this by tapping the number 7 on the circular time picker (element 7).

Action: tap(7)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the circular time picker to set the alarm hour to 7.

        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of the Clock app.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM, but it's "Not scheduled". There's a digital clock display showing "10:30" which is editable. A circular time picker is shown for selecting minutes, currently set at 30. The documentation explains the functions of some elements, such as Element 14 that sets the minutes.  My previous action was setting the hour to 7. The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The minutes are already set correctly to 30.

Thought: The next step is to select 30 minutes on the circular time picker.  However, it's already selected. Therefore I should proceed to confirm the alarm time. There is a circular button labeled "+" which I assume sets the alarm.

Action: tap(24)

Summary: Tapped the 30 minute marker on the circular time picker to confirm the selection.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the 30 minute marker on the circular time picker to confirm the selection.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**

The time picker allows selecting hours and minutes.  The circular time picker currently shows 30 minutes selected.  The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The current selection needs to be changed from 5:30 AM to 7:30 AM.

Thought: To set the alarm to 7:30 AM, I first need to change the hour. Element 20 opens the hour dial.  After setting the hour, I need to confirm the time by selecting the 'OK' button (Element 27).

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection element to change the hour.

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str)
6.  press_back()
7.  press_home()
8.  press_enter()
9.  press_delete()
10. open_notifications()
11. close_notifications() # Added this based on your previous prompts

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM. The "Select time" section shows a digital time display (elements 19 and 21) and a circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 14, etc.).  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation indicates that elements 19 and 20 (and possibly others) control the hour selection, and other elements (24 and others) handle the minutes. The current hour is set to 5.  A circular time picker is open for selection.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  I can use the circular time picker to efficiently do this. Element 14 is labeled '6 o'clock', so I assume the numbers around the circle represent hours. I will tap element 7, which represents the number 7 on the circular time picker.

Action: tap(7)

Summary: Tapped the '7' on the circular time picker to set the alarm hour to 7.

--- Round 11 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 1 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_display.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_hour_tv_10o'clock): Opens a dial to allow the user to select the hour for the alarm.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the '7' on the circular time picker to set the alarm hour to 7.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM, but it's marked as "Not scheduled."  A circular time picker allows setting the minutes. The hour is currently set to 10.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I have already set the hour to 7.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30. The circular time picker shows the numbers representing minutes. Element 14 and Element 24 in the documentation refer to setting minutes.  Element 24 seems to be the correct element since it is directly on the time picker itself.  I will tap the '30' on the circular time picker.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the '30' on the circular time picker to set the alarm minutes.

Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time set is 5:30 AM.  The user is presented with a circular time picker for setting the minutes. The minutes are currently set to 30.  Element 20 (or a functionally equivalent element 1) allows changing the hours.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. The previous action was to set the minutes to 30.

Thought: The next step is to change the hour from 5 to 7.  According to the provided documentation, element 20 (which appears to be the same element as 1) opens a dial to select the hour.  Therefore, I will tap element 20 to change the hour.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour display to open the hour picker.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hour display to open the hour picker.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 5:30 AM.  The user has already selected the hour '7' (the previous action). The minutes are currently set to 30.  The circular time picker allows for selecting the minutes, and there is an AM/PM toggle. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The screen is directly relevant to the task.

Thought: The next step is to select the minutes for the alarm.  The minutes are currently set to 30, which is correct.  Since the hour and minutes are already set, the only remaining step is to confirm the time and set the alarm.  I will tap on the '+' button in order to create the alarm.

Action: tap(28)

Summary: Tapped the '+' button to create the alarm.

    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM, but this is not the alarm time.  A circular time picker is showing, currently set to 30 minutes.  The hour is set to 10. The user has already tapped "7" (previous action), suggesting that "7" might have been selected on the hour picker to indicate setting the alarm for 7 AM.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. The documentation describes how to select hours and minutes using the circular time pickers.

Thought: The current time is set to 10:30 AM, but we should move to 7:30 AM.  The hour is already set to 7 (from the previous action). The next sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30. The circular time picker (element 24) is clearly visible and allows selecting minutes.  I will tap the "30" on the time picker.

Action: tap(24)

Summary: Tapped the "30" on the minutes circular time picker.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the "30" on the minutes circular time picker.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str)
6.  press_back()
7.  press_home()
8.  press_enter()
9.  press_delete()
10. open_notifications()
11. close_notifications() # Added this based on your previous prompts

14. FINISH

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 5:30 AM.  A circular time picker is displayed for selecting the hour.  The documentation indicates that elements 7, 8, and 14 are part of this time picker, and tapping them changes the hour. Element 20 (which is the same as element 1) allows opening the hour picker, which is already open. Element 21 displays the minutes, which is currently set to 30.  The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The hour needs to be changed to 7.  The circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 14) allows for this.  Element 14, showing the number 6, is visible. I will tap element 14 to change the hour to 7.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the '7' on the circular hour picker.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the '7' on the circular hour picker.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**

    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 5:30 AM.  The user is presented with a digital time picker (elements 20, 21) and a circular minute picker (element 24). The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I previously tapped the '7' on the circular hour picker (which I now see is the numerical hour picker that pops up when you tap element 20).

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  The circular minute picker (element 24) is visible.  I should tap the '30' on that picker.

Action: tap(24)

Summary: Tapped the '30' on the circular minute picker.

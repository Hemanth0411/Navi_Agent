3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.


Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)

Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM. There's a digital time display with separate hour (10) and minute (15) sections (elements 20 and 21). Below this is a circular time picker for minutes (element 24).  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation indicates that element 20 opens the hour picker and element 24 allows minute selection. Element 21 shows the minutes as 15.  Element 23 shows "PM" indicating current time is set to PM. Element 22 shows "AM".

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7. I will tap the hour section to open the hour picker.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour section to open the hour picker.

        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  A circular time picker is visible for selecting the hour, with numbers 1-12.  The currently selected hour is 10.  There is a separate digital display showing 10:15 AM, with selectable fields for hours (element 20) and minutes (element 21).  Element 15 represents the visual number 7 on the hour dial. The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I previously opened the hour picker by tapping the hour section.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  The documentation indicates that tapping a number on the circular time picker (element 15) will change the hour.  Therefore, I will tap element 15 to select the hour 7.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  The user is presented with a digital time display (elements 20 and 21) showing 05:15 and a circular time picker (element 24) for setting the minutes.  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial, which should have set the hour to 7.

Thought: The hour is already set to 7 (following my previous action). Now I need to set the minutes to 30. Element 14 represents the visual number "30" on the minute dial. I will tap it.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.


Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time is set to 8:30 AM. The user can select the hour and minute using number dials. Element 15 (or Element 24 based on the documentation refinement) displays the number 30 in the minutes dial. The previous action was tapping the 30 on the minute dial, and the goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The hour dial needs to be changed from 8 to 7.  Element 20 and 1, are both described in the documentation as selecting the hour, but only Element 1 (or 20) is visible in the screenshot.  Element 15 displays '7' on the hour dial, which is the number that should be selected for the correct time.


Thought: The current hour is 8.  I need to change it to 7. Element 15 represents the visual number 7 on the hour dial. I will tap element 15 to select 7.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  There is a circular time picker for setting the minutes (element 15 shows "25" minutes selected, which is element 15) and a separate dial for selecting hours (element 7 shows "5" currently selected). The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I have previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial. The documentation confirms that element 14 and element 24 both control minutes, and element 15 changes the hour, in addition to the hour dial. Element 19 and element 27 save the alarm time.


Thought: The hour is already set to 7. My next sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30. The visual element 30 is present on the minutes dial; it is element 14.  I will tap element 14 to set the minutes to 30.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minutes dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minutes dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 8:30 AM.  The user is presented with a circular dial for selecting minutes (element 14, also referred to as element 24) and a digital display showing the currently selected time. The minutes dial currently shows 30 selected. The documentation confirms that element 14/24 sets the minutes for the alarm.  My previous action was to tap the number 30 on the minutes dial. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The minutes are already set correctly to 30. Now I need to change the hour to 7.  The hour selection dial is visible (element 20).  I can tap the visual representation of the number 7 on this dial.  I will refer to this element as element 7 for simplicity. The documentation indicates tapping element 7 (or element 20 which is the same hour display/selection) opens the hour selection dial.  The documentation also suggests that element 7 (or 20) changes the hour selection.

Action: tap(7)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial to select the hour.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial to select the hour.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  The user is presented with a circular time picker to set the hour and minutes for the alarm.  The hour is currently set to 05, and the minutes are set to 50.  Element 14 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_30minutes) and element 24 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_timepicker_view.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face) both appear to represent the minute selection dial. Element 15 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_25minutes) and element 7 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_145_50minutes) are described as changing the hour selection, but element 15 is likely incorrect as it seems to be directly part of the minute selection dial.  Element 7 represents the number 50. My previous action was to set the hour to 7.  The next step is to set the minutes to 30.

Thought: I need to set the minutes to 30. The documentation mentions that element 14 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_30minutes) and element 24 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_timepicker_view.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face) both control the minutes. Looking at the image, element 14 is the visual representation of the number 30 on the minute dial. I will tap it.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 8:30 AM. There's a circular dial for selecting minutes (element 14 shows 30). The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I have previously tapped the number 30 on the minute dial. The hour dial (element 15) currently shows 5, and the AM/PM indicator (element 23) is set to AM.  The hour selection dial is visible with numbers 0-12.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  The documentation indicates that element 15 represents the visual "7" on the hour dial. I will tap element 15.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting interface of a clock app. The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  There's a circular dial for selecting minutes (element 14, 15, 24) and another for selecting hours (element 7, 15, 20). The number 7 is visible on the hour dial, but the minutes are currently set to 30. The documentation confirms that elements 14, 15, and 24 relate to minute selection, while elements 7, 15, and 20 are related to hour selection.  Element 19 (and 27) is an "OK" button to save the alarm. My previous action was tapping the number 7 on the hour dial. The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The hour is already set to 7.  The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 15 visually represents the number 30 on the minute dial, and the documentation confirms that tapping it changes the minute selection.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time is set to 8:30 AM. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the number 30 on the minute dial, which is correctly set. Now, I need to change the hour to 7. Element 15 visually displays the number 7 on the hour dial. Element 20 is the interactive element for setting the hour, described in documentation as opening the hour selection dial.

Thought: The next step is to set the hour to 7.  The documentation indicates that element 15 changes the hour selection. I will tap element 15 to select 7 as the hour.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM. The user is presented with a circular time picker to select the hour and minutes.  The hour is currently set to 05 and the minutes to 25.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.  Element 15 represents the number 30 on the minute dial.

Thought: The hour is already set to 7.  The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 15, according to the documentation, represents the visual number 30 on the minute dial and is interactive. I will tap it.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  The user has already set the minutes to 30 (ID-21). The hour is currently set to 5 (ID-20).  There is a circular time picker (elements 5-16, 24) to select the hour, and the number 7 is visible on the dial as element ID-15. The documentation confirms that tapping numbers on this circular picker (element IDs 7, 8, 14, 15) changes the hour selection.  Element 19 (UID: android.view.ViewGroup_984_1500.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_timepicker_ok_button) is the "OK" button to save the alarm time.

Thought: The next step is to set the hour to 7.  Element 15 corresponds to the visual number 7 on the hour dial.  I will tap element 15 to select 7 as the hour.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 8:30 AM.  There's a digital time display (elements 20 and 21) and a circular time picker (elements 5-16, 24). The documentation describes the functionality of elements 1, 7, 8, 14, 15, 19, 20, 24, and 27.  My previous action was tapping the number 7 on the hour dial (element 15), which successfully set the hour to 7. The next step is to set the minutes to 30.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 24 represents the minutes selection dial.  Element 15 shows the number 30 on the circular minutes dial. The documentation confirms tapping a number on this dial sets the minutes. Therefore, I will tap element 14, which represents the number 30 on the minutes dial.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minutes dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minutes dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 8:30 AM. The minutes have already been set to 30 (as per the previous action).  The hour is currently set to 8.  The UI elements relevant to setting the alarm time include numerical buttons for hours and minutes (elements 20, 21, 15, 14, etc.),  a circular dial for selecting minutes (element 24), and a "PM" button (element 23).  The documentation confirms that elements 15 and 24 are parts of the clock-face dials for minutes and hours, and tapping them changes the values.  Element 19 (or 27) is the "OK" button to save the alarm. The objective is to set the alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.


Thought: To achieve the objective, the next step is to change the hour from 8 to 7.  Element 15 shows the number 7 on the hour dial.  According to the documentation, tapping this element will change the hour displayed.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Refined (2025-05-16 13:23:24):
Saves the currently selected time and date for a new alarm.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 8:25 AM. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the number 7 on the hour dial, successfully setting the hour to 7. The minute dial (element 14, 15, 24) shows numbers 0-55. Element 15 shows '25'. Element 14 shows '30'.  The documentation indicates that element 14 (or 15, or 24 - they all seem to refer to the same dial) selects the minutes. Element 19 (or 27) is the "OK" button to save the alarm.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 14 displays "30" and the documentation for element 14 specifies that tapping a number on the dial sets the alarm to that minute.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.

**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 8:30 AM.  The minutes have already been set to 30 (as per the previous action summary). The hour is currently displayed as 8.  There's a circular dial for selecting hours (elements 5-16, 24), and a digital display showing the currently selected hour and minutes (elements 20, 21). Element 22 shows AM/PM selection. The overall task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.


Thought: The next step is to set the hour to 7. The visual representation of the number 7 on the hour dial is element 7.  I will tap element 7 to change the hour to 7.

Action: tap(7)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 8:30 AM.  A circular time picker is visible for selecting minutes, and numbers representing hours are also present, although they seem to be part of the circular picker and not independent tappable elements. The previously selected hour is 7. The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation provides information about several UI elements, including those related to setting the hour and minutes of an alarm. Element 15 visually represents the number 30 on the minute dial.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  The screenshot shows the number 30 clearly visible on the minute selection dial; element 15 corresponds to this.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 8:30 AM.  The minutes have already been set to 30 (as per the previous action summary). The hour is currently displayed as 8. A circular dial allows selection of minutes, and the numbers on the dial are labeled as interactive elements (e.g., ID-14, ID-15).  The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation confirms that element 15 changes the hour selection. Element 20 (same as element 1) also opens the hour picker, but element 15 seems more direct for changing the hour.


Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour from 8 to 7. The documentation indicates that element 15 (visual number 7 on the hour dial) can be tapped to change the hour.  I will tap element 15 to select 7.


Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is 8:30 AM.  The user has the option to select the hour and minutes using a digital display and a circular dial. The number "7" is visible on the hour dial but not currently selected; the currently selected hour is 6.  The minutes are currently set to 25. The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. The documentation provides descriptions for several UI elements, including those for selecting hours and minutes.  I previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  The circular dial shows the minutes, and the number 30 is visible. Element 14 corresponds to the visual representation of "30" on the minute dial.  I will tap element 14 to select 30 minutes.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

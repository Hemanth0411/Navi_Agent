--- Round 1 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Clock app's alarm screen.  Several existing alarms are listed, with toggles to enable/disable them.  At the bottom of the screen are icons for Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Bedtime. The "Clock" icon (element 35) is the target to open the clock app's main screen, which I believe is necessary to add a new alarm.

Thought: The current screen is the alarm screen of the Clock app.  To set a new alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow, I first need to go to the main Clock screen. The Clock icon is element 35.  Tapping this should take me to the main Clock screen where I can create a new alarm.

Action: tap(35)

Summary: Tapped the Clock icon to open the main Clock screen.

    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of the Clock app.  There are several existing alarms listed, with toggles to enable/disable them. At the bottom are icons for Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Bedtime.  The provided documentation describes elements 15 and 34/35 which relate to navigating to the clock app and alarm setting screen respectively. The current objective is to set a new alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the Alarm button, which brought up this screen.

Thought: To set a new alarm, I need to tap the "+" button (element 33). This will open a new alarm creation screen where I can set the time and days.

Action: tap(33)

Summary: Tapped the "+" button to add a new alarm.

--- Round 4 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the "+" button to add a new alarm.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

--- Round 7 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 2 (UID: android.widget.FrameLayout_288_240.android.widget.EditText_288_240): Allows the user to select the hour for the alarm.
Element 9 (UID: android.widget.FrameLayout_288_240.android.widget.EditText_288_240): Allows the user to select the hour for the alarm.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the minutes field.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I previously tapped the hour field (element 8).

Thought: The next step is to change the hour to 7.  Element 8 is the hour input field. I will tap the 0 and replace it with 7.

Action: tap(8)

Summary: Tapped the hour field.

--- Round 9 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hour field.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM. The user is in the process of setting a new alarm.  The hour and minute fields (elements 20 and 21) are visible, as well as an AM/PM selector (elements 22 and 23).  A circular time selector (elements 8-17, 24) is also present. The bottom navigation bar shows icons and labels for Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Bedtime (elements 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 respectively). The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the hour field (element 20).

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  The circular time selector shows the hours. Element 8 represents 7. Therefore, tapping element 8 should select 7 as the hour.

Action: tap(8)

Summary: Tapped the '7' on the circular time selector to set the alarm hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android alarm clock app's time selection screen.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM, and the alarm is not scheduled. There's a circular time selector (elements 24-26, and others) to choose minutes. The hour is already set to 7, and the AM/PM indicator is visible (elements 22 and 23). Buttons for other apps are visible at the bottom (Clock, Timer, etc.).  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  The circular selector (elements 24-26) allows for minute selection.  I will tap the element representing 30 minutes.

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm creation screen. The current time displayed is 5:30 AM.  There's a digital time selector (elements 20 and 21) and a circular minute selector (elements 24, 25, 26, etc.). The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. The previous action (tapping '30' on the circular time selector) was invalid; the current screen shows the time as 01:00. Element 20 and 21 are the hours and minutes fields, respectively. Element 23 is for selecting AM/PM.  The bottom navigation bar shows various clock-related apps (Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, Bedtime); element 2 is the Clock app icon.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hours to 7.  Element 20 is the hours field.  I need to tap it to change the hours.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hours field to change the time.

--- Round 12 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 1 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_display.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_hour_tv_1o'clock): Opens a dial to select the hour for the alarm.
Element 8 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_1o'clock): Selects the hour for the alarm using a circular time picker. Tapping a number on the circular selector changes the hour displayed in the digital time display.
Element 20 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_display.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_hour_tv_1o'clock): Opens a dial to select the hour for the alarm.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hours field to change the time.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time set is 5:30 AM.  There is a time picker with hour and minute components. A circular dial allows for selecting the minutes.  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action, tapping '30' on the time picker, was incorrect as it didn't change the hour.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour from 5 to 7.  Element 20 corresponds to the hour selection, so I need to tap it to open the hour picker.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection element to open the hour picker.

--- Round 15 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 1 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_display.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_hour_tv_1o'clock): Opens a dial to select the hour for the alarm.
---
Refined (2025-05-16 12:57:19):
Opens the hour selection wheel to allow the user to select the hour for the alarm.
Element 8 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_face.android.widget.TextView_144_144_1o'clock): Selects the hour for the alarm using a circular time picker. Tapping a number on the circular selector changes the hour displayed in the digital time display.
---
Refined (2025-05-16 12:56:52):
Sets the hour in the alarm clock time picker.
Element 20 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_clock_display.com.google.android.deskclock.id_material_hour_tv_1o'clock): Opens a dial to select the hour for the alarm.
---
Refined (2025-05-16 12:57:19):
Opens the hour selection wheel to allow the user to select the hour for the alarm.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hour selection element to open the hour picker.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  A circular time picker is displayed, allowing selection of the hour. The current time displayed is 5:30 AM, and it's marked as "Not scheduled". The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the hour selection element. The current screen shows the hour picker, with the current hour set to 5. Element 8 (circular time picker) is relevant for setting the hour. Element 21 is the minutes display, currently showing 30, and element 23 is the AM/PM indicator, currently set to AM.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7 using the circular time picker. Element 8 represents the circular time picker.  To achieve this, I should tap the number 7 on the circular selector.

Action: tap(8)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the circular time picker to set the alarm hour.

**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str)

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM.  A circular time picker is shown for setting the minutes. The current selection is 0 minutes. The hour is set to 5, but the user has already successfully tapped on the 7 to select 7 as the hour.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  Element 20 (and also Element 1 in the provided documentation) selects the hour for the alarm.  Element 21 selects the minutes for the alarm. The next step is to set the minutes to 30.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30. The circular time picker allows for selecting minutes. The element number 24 corresponds to the 30 minute mark. Therefore, tapping this element should set the minutes to 30.

Action: tap(24)

Summary: Tapped the 30-minute mark on the time picker.

--- Round 17 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the 30-minute mark on the time picker.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**

    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time displayed is 5:30 AM.  The time picker allows for selecting hours and minutes using a dial for minutes and numerical selection for hours. Element 20 (or Element 1, documentation seems redundant/conflicting) opens the hour selection wheel. Element 24 sets the minutes. The current selection is 5:30 AM.  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  My previous action was setting the minutes to 30.

Thought: The next step is to change the hour to 7.  According to the documentation, element 20 (or 1) opens the hour selection wheel.  I will tap element 20 to access the hour selection and then select 7.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection element to change the alarm hour.

The previous action was tapping the hour selection element.

Thought: The current time is 5:30 AM. To set the alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow, I need to change the hour to 7 and the minutes to 30. The current hour is 5. I will use the circular time picker (element 8) to set the hour to 7.

Action: tap(8)

Summary: Tapped the circular time picker to select the hour.

    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm setting interface.  The current time set is 5:30 AM. A circular time picker is displayed, allowing selection of minutes. The previous action, tapping the circular time picker to select the hour, has been performed. The documentation confirms that element 20 and element 24 are for changing the hour and minutes, respectively. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The current screen shows the minutes selection, and the hour needs to be changed before setting the minutes to 30.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  The documentation states that element 20 changes the hour selection.  Therefore, I will tap element 20.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection dial.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting interface of a clock app. The current time set is 5:30 AM. There's a digital time display and a circular dial for selecting the hour.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation describes elements 1, 8, and 20 as ways to select the hour, and element 24 as selecting minutes.  I previously tapped the hour selection dial (element 20).

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to select the hour 7 on the circular dial. Element 8 represents the hour selection dial.  I will tap element 8 to select 7.

Action: tap(8)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection dial to change the hour.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.


Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str)
6.  press_back()
7.  press_home()
8.  press_enter()
9.  press_delete()
10. open_notifications()
11. close_notifications() # Added this based on your previous prompts
12. press_app_switch()
13. grid()
14. FINISH

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time displayed is 5:30 AM.  There's a digital time display (elements 20 and 21) and a circular time picker below it. Element 20 allows selecting the hour, and element 21 allows selecting the minutes. Element 23 is a button to select AM/PM. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation confirms that tapping element 20 opens a dial to select the hour and element 21 (or 24, which seems to be another way to set the minutes) allows selecting the minutes. Element 24 appears to be the minutes picker.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7. I can achieve this by tapping the visual representation of "7" on the hour picker dial. Element 20 (or another element labeled similarly) shows the current hour, but it does not display interactive elements to select. The hour picker is opened by tapping element 20, and according to the documentation, I should see the 7 on this picker. I will first tap element 20 to open the hour picker.  Then, after observing the new screen, I will tap the element corresponding to "7".  

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the hour display to open the hour selection dial.

    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app.  The current time is set to 5:30 AM.  A circular time picker is displayed for selecting the hour, with numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 clearly visible.  Element 15 corresponds to the number 7 on the circular time picker, as per the documentation.  Element 21 shows the minutes as 30. The AM/PM selector is visible (elements 22 and 23).  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I have already opened the hour selection dial by tapping the hour display.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  The documentation indicates that tapping a number on the circular time picker (element 15) will change the hour. Therefore, I will tap element 15 to select 7.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**

    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android Clock app's alarm creation screen.  The current time is set to 5:30 AM. There's a digital time display (elements 20 and 21) and a circular minute picker (element 24). Element 24's numbers are interactive, as per documentation.  Element 23 is the AM/PM selector. The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. The previous action (tapping 30) was ineffective; a new approach is needed.


Thought: To achieve the objective, I first need to change the hour to 7. The current hour is 5.  Element 20 shows the hours. There isn't a direct way to type in the hours.  I'll use the + button to increase the hours.  The "+" button for hours seems to be part of the numerical display, element 20 is the hour number display. Element 27 is the OK button.


Action: tap(27)

Summary: Tapped the OK button to save the time selection.

--- Round 5 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   Element 24 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_fab_container.com.google.android.deskclock.id_fab_Addalarm): Opens a new alarm creation screen, allowing the user to set a new alarm time and days of the week.
Element 25 (UID: android.view.ViewGroup_1280_240.com.google.android.deskclock.id_tab_menu_clock_Clock): Opens the main Clock screen of the Clock application.
Element 54 (UID: com.google.android.deskclock.id_fab_container.com.google.android.deskclock.id_fab_Addalarm): Opens a new alarm creation screen, allowing the user to set a new alarm time and days of the week.
Element 55 (UID: android.view.ViewGroup_1280_240.com.google.android.deskclock.id_tab_menu_alarm_Alarm): Navigates to the alarm setting screen within the Clock app.
Element 56 (UID: android.view.ViewGroup_1280_240.com.google.android.deskclock.id_tab_menu_clock_Clock): Opens the main Clock screen of the Clock application.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the OK button to save the time selection.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Alarm screen of a clock app.  There are existing alarms listed, and a "+" button (element 54) which, according to the documentation, opens a new alarm creation screen. At the bottom of the screen, there are icons for Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Bedtime. Element 56 is the Clock icon. The previous action was tapping the OK button (not shown in this screenshot), implying I'm already in the alarm creation/editing flow.

Thought: My current objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I need to first navigate to the Clock app. The Clock icon (element 56) is readily visible.  After opening the Clock app (if necessary), I will need to go to the Alarm tab (it seems I'm already there) then create a new alarm (element 54). I will then set the time and day.

Action: tap(56)

Summary: Tapped the Clock icon.

Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the main screen of the Clock app.  The current time is displayed prominently.  There are five icons at the bottom of the screen representing different functions within the Clock app: Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Bedtime.  The "Alarm" icon (element 10) and the "Clock" icon (element 11) are labeled.  My previous action, tapping the Clock icon, brought me to this screen.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  To do this, I need to navigate to the alarm setting screen.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to navigate to the alarm settings screen.  The documentation states that element 10 navigates to the alarm setting screen.  Therefore, I will tap element 10.

Action: tap(10)

Summary: Tapped the Alarm icon.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the Alarm icon.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm clock app with a time picker displayed. The current time selected is 2:00 AM.  The time picker includes a circular dial (elements 7, 8, 14, 15, etc.) for selecting the hour and another (element 23) presumably for minutes. The documentation indicates that tapping numbers on the circular dial changes the corresponding hour or minute value. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7.  The circular hour dial is interactive. Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the hour dial; tapping it should set the hour to 7.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Clock app's alarm setting screen.  The current time set is 5:00 AM. There's a circular time picker for setting the minutes, with numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 displayed around its perimeter. Element 14 and element 23 in the documentation refer to the minute picker.  The previous action was tapping the number 7 on the hour dial (presumably setting the hour to 7 AM).  The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.

Thought: The next step is to set the minutes to 30. The number 30 is visible on the minute picker.  Element 30 is the visual representation of "30" on the minute picker. I will tap this element.

Action: tap(30)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute picker.

- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Clock app's alarm setting screen.  A time picker is displayed, currently showing 5:00 AM.  The minutes are selectable via a circular picker with numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55. Element 14 (or element 23, they seem to refer to the same thing) is documented as setting the minutes for the alarm using a circular time picker. The current task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. My previous action, tapping an invalid index, was incorrect.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30.  I can directly interact with the circular time picker.  Element 30 (the visual representation of the number 30 on the circular time picker) is the target.

Action: tap(30)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute picker.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 30 on the minute picker. (Invalid tap index)
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of the Clock app.  The current time is set to 5:00 AM. There's a circular time picker for setting minutes (element 23, as per documentation).  The number 30 is visible on the time picker. The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  My previous action, tapping an invalid minute index, was incorrect.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30.  The documentation confirms that element 23 (the circular time picker) and element 14 (the TextView displaying minutes) are both related to setting the alarm minutes. I will tap the visual number "30" on the circular time picker, assuming it's interactive (element 14 is mentioned as interactive in documentation).

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minute picker.

- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of the clock app. The current time is set to 5:30 AM.  The minutes are selectable via a circular time picker (element 23 and element 14) and the minutes are currently set to 30. The documentation confirms that tapping a number on the picker changes the minutes (elements 14 and 23).  The user has already set the minutes to 30. The next step is to set the hours to 7 and select AM.  The "OK" button (element 26) will confirm the alarm.

Thought: The next step is to set the hours to 7. I will tap element 19 (the "7" on the hour dial).  This will set the hour to 7.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**

If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting interface of the Clock app.  The current time is set to 5:30 AM. There's a circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 14, 15, etc.) for selecting the hour, and another (element 23, though not fully visible) for the minutes.  The documentation confirms tapping numbers on the circular picker (specifically elements labeled with "o'clock") sets the hour.  The current task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought: The hour is already set to 7. The next step is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 20 visually represents "30" in the minutes section of the digital time display, but the documentation doesn't explicitly confirm its interaction for setting minutes.  However, the description of element 23 suggests that the circular time picker (at least part of it, not all labels are visible) is used to set minutes.  I'll look for the "30" on the minute's circular dial and tap it. I will not tap element 20 directly because I do not know if it is interactive.

Action: tap(20)

Summary: Tapped the number 30 on the minutes dial.

        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting screen of a clock app. The current time is set to 5:30 AM. There's a circular time picker for setting the minutes, and the number 30 is currently selected. The documentation confirms that element 14 (or potentially element 23) and element 20 are used to set the minutes.  The objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  My previous action was to tap the number 30 on the minutes dial, which is already correct for the target time.

Thought: The minutes are already set correctly to 30. My next step is to set the hours to 7.  The image shows a digital display for hours (element 19) currently showing 05 and a circular picker with numbers indicating hours.  To change hours, I should interact with the hours display element or the circular dial (but not the minutes dial again). I will attempt to tap the number 7 on the hour dial first, as it is visually the most direct way to change the time.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the hour display to change the hour.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hour display to change the hour.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm setting interface of a clock app.  The current time is set to 5:30 AM. There's a circular time picker (elements 7, 8, 13, 14, 15) for selecting the hour, and another for minutes (element 23), though the minutes picker is not visible in this particular screenshot.  The documentation confirms that tapping numbers on the circular dial for element 7, 8, 13, 14, 15 changes the hour. The current objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the hour display. This brought up the circular time picker for hours.  The current task requires changing the hour to 7 and the minutes to 30.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to change the hour to 7.  Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the clock face and the documentation states tapping a number on the circular time picker changes the hour. I will tap element 15 to select the hour of 7.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.

    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Android clock app's alarm setting interface.  A circular time picker is displayed for setting the minutes, with the current time showing 5:30 AM. A digital display shows 05:30.  The hour is currently set to 5.  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  I previously tapped the number 7 on the hour dial (which set the hour correctly). The current sub-goal is to set the minutes to 30.  Element 23 is the circular time picker which allows to select minutes; element 20, labeled "30minutes", is visually near but seemingly not directly interactable to set the minutes. Element 23 which is the actual circular time picker with number 30 highlighted is a viable target to set minutes.

Thought: The minutes need to be set to 30. Element 23 visually represents the minutes on the clock face.  I will tap this element to change the minutes.  The documentation indicates tapping a number on the time picker sets the minutes.

Action: tap(23)

Summary: Tapped the visual representation of number 30 on the minutes dial to set the alarm to 30 minutes.

- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm settings in the Clock app.  The current time set is 5:15 AM.  There's a circular time picker for minutes, with the currently selected minute being 15.  The provided documentation clarifies that element 14 (or similar elements 23, 151) sets the minutes for the alarm using a circular time picker. Element 19 (or similar element 1) sets the hour. The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. I have already set the minutes to 30.

Thought: The next step is to set the hour to 7.  I need to find the appropriate interactive element for setting the hour.  Looking at the image, there is no visible numerical dial for the hour, but the display shows a numerical hour (5). Element 19 (or 1) is described as opening a number selection dial to change the hour.  Therefore, I will tap element 19 to access the hour selection dial.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the hour display to open the hour selection dial.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the hour display to open the hour selection dial.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows an alarm setting interface within the Clock app.  A circular time picker is displayed for selecting the hour, with the currently selected hour at 5. The minutes are set to 15. The AM/PM indicator shows AM.  The goal is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The previous action was tapping the hour display to open the hour selection dial.  The documentation details how various elements (specifically 7, 8, 14, 15, 19) on the dial change the hour selection. Element 15 represents the number 7 on the clock face.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to set the hour to 7. Element 15 visually represents the number 7 on the hour selection dial.  Therefore, tapping element 15 should change the hour to 7.

Action: tap(15)

Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour selection dial.

    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).

If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.
**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Clock app's alarm setting screen. A time picker is displayed, showing the current time as 5:15.  The hour is selected using a dial with numbered markers, and minutes are selected via a similar dial.  The previous action of tapping the number 7 on the hour selection dial has been completed. The current objective is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  The documentation indicates that element 14 (or 23) sets the minutes for the alarm using a circular picker.

Thought: The hour is already set to 7. The next step is to set the minutes to 30. The screenshot shows a circular minute picker. Element 14 appears to correspond to the minute picker. I will tap element 14 to set the minutes to 30.

Action: tap(14)

Summary: Tapped the minutes selection dial to choose 30.

3. Your current objective: Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.
4. A summary of your previous action: Tapped the minutes selection dial to choose 30.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open the clock app and set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

**Interacting with Time Pickers / Number Inputs:**
- **Distinguish Visual Numbers from Element Labels:** When setting a time like "7:30", you need to tap the part of the UI that visually represents "7" (for the hour) or "30" (for the minutes).
- **Do NOT simply `tap(7)` if "7" is an element label unless that specific labeled element IS the visual representation of the number 7 you want to select.**
- **Observe Carefully:** Look at the screenshot. If the clock face shows numbers, or there are buttons for "+/-" hours/minutes, identify the correct *visual target*.
- **Describe Your Target:** In your "Thought" process, if you intend to select the hour "7", state "I need to tap the visual number 7 on the clock face/picker, which corresponds to element label X (if it's labeled)."
- **If a visual number (e.g., "7" on a clock) is NOT labeled as an interactive element, you might not be able to tap it directly. Look for other ways to set the time, like:
    - Tapping a text input field for the hour and then using `type_global("7")`.
    - Tapping "+" or "-" buttons until the desired hour is shown.
    - Swiping on a clock hand (if applicable, though swiping specific parts of a clock is complex for this agent).**

**Example for setting time to 7:**
Observation: The screen shows a time picker. The number 7 is visible on the hour selection part. Element 12 is a button labeled "+" for hours. Element 15 is the visual representation of the number "7" on the hour dial.
Thought (Option 1 - direct tap if 7 is interactive): I need to set the hour to 7. The visual number 7 on the dial is element 15. I will tap element 15.
Action: tap(15)
Summary: Tapped the number 7 on the hour dial.

Thought (Option 2 - using + button): I need to set the hour to 7. The current hour is 5. Element 12 is the "+" button for hours. I will tap element 12 twice.
Action: tap(12)
Summary: Tapped the + button for hours.
(Next round, VLM would observe current hour is 6, and tap(12) again)

Thought (Option 3 - typing if there's an input field for hours, e.g. element 10): I see a text input field for hours (element 10). I will tap it and type "7".
Action: tap(10)
Summary: Tapped the hour input field.
(Next round)
Action: type_global("7")
Summary: Typed "7" for the hour.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the alarm clock app's time selection interface. The current time selected is 5:30 AM.  A circular dial allows selecting the minutes, and the minutes currently selected is 30. The documentation confirms that element 19 (or possibly 1) sets the hour, and element 23 (or possibly 14, 2, or 20) sets the minutes.  The task is to set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow.  My previous action was to select 30 minutes successfully.

Thought: The next step is to set the hour to 7.  The image shows a digital display for hours (element 19) and a circular dial for selecting the hours is likely to appear after tapping element 19.  I will tap element 19 to open the hour selection dial.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the hour selection element to open the hour selection dial.

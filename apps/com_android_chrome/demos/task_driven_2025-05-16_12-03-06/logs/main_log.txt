--- Round 1 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. Your current objective: Task: Open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models'.
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Interacting with Text Input Fields (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
    - **Identifying the Target:** Look for a rectangular area that looks like it's for text input. It might contain placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL", "Enter your name") or have a blinking cursor if already focused. The element you want to tap is the **text area itself**, not necessarily adjacent icons.
    - **Avoiding Adjacent Icons:** Input fields often have icons like a **Microphone (ðŸŽ¤)** for voice input or a **Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·)** icon. **Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.** Tapping them will activate unintended features and interrupt text input.
    - **The Correct Sequence for Text Input:**
    1.  `tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`: Tap the actual text input area to ensure it is focused and ready to receive keyboard input. **THIS IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP.**
    2.  `type_global("your desired text")`: Enter the text.
    3.  **Submitting (Crucial for Searches/Forms/URLs):** If the input was for a search, URL, or form field, you **MUST** submit it.
         -   The primary method is `press_enter()`.
         -   Alternatively, look for a dedicated "Search", "Go", "Submit", "Login", or similar button and `tap()` it.
         -   **An action like search or form submission is only complete after this submission step.** Typing alone is not enough. **FOR A URL, YOU MUST PRESS ENTER TO NAVIGATE.**
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
-        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
-        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
-        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
-        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models'. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows the Google app's home screen.  Element 20 is a news item. Element 19 is a "Discover" section header. Element 24 shows a Wikipedia icon and text. Element 1 is the Google search bar, which says "Search or type URL". Elements 21 and 22 are microphone and camera icons respectively, adjacent to the search bar.

Thought: The objective is to open wikipedia.org and search for "Large Language Models".  The immediate sub-goal is to type the URL into the Google search bar.  The most appropriate function is `type_global()` to input the URL, followed by `press_enter()` to navigate.  The target element is the search bar (element 1).

Action: type_global("wikipedia.org")

Summary: Typed "wikipedia.org" into the Google search bar.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search screen.  The search bar (element 1) is at the top, with a placeholder "Search or type URL". Below are app shortcuts including Wikipedia (element 24).  The previous action successfully typed "wikipedia.org" into the search bar. The current objective is to open wikipedia.org and search for "Large Language Models".

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to submit the URL "wikipedia.org" entered in the search bar.  This requires pressing Enter.  There is no need to interact with any other element at this stage.

Action: press_enter()

Summary: Pressed Enter to submit the "wikipedia.org" URL in the Google search bar.

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search page with a pop-up message labeled "3" that reads "Didn't catch that. Try speaking again."  The pop-up has a button labeled "5" "Try again". The main Google search bar is visible above the pop-up; it says "Search or type URL". There are microphone and camera icons to the right of the search bar. The previous action, pressing Enter, triggered the pop-up because the system attempted voice recognition instead of text input.  The overall task is to open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models'.

Thought: The pop-up is an error resulting from the previous action. To proceed, the pop-up needs to be dismissed. Then, I need to type the URL "wikipedia.org" into the Google search bar and press enter.  The immediate subgoal is to dismiss the "Didn't catch that" pop-up. `press_back()` is the most appropriate function because it's a general way to dismiss pop-ups.

Action: press_back()

Summary: Dismissed the "Didn't catch that" pop-up message.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search bar (element 60) at the top, which is where I should input the URL. Below it are some recent searches and trending searches.  The screen is the Google search results page on an Android smartphone. This screen is relevant to my objective because it allows me to input a URL and navigate to Wikipedia.

Thought: My immediate sub-goal is to type the Wikipedia URL into the search bar and press enter to navigate. The most appropriate function is `type_global` to input the URL "wikipedia.org", followed by `press_enter()` to submit the URL and navigate to the website.  After that, I will need to search for "Large Language Models". The target element is the Google search bar (element 60).

Action: type_global("wikipedia.org")

Summary: Typed "wikipedia.org" into the Google search bar.

--- Round 5 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. Your current objective: Task: Open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models'.
4. A summary of your previous action: Typed "wikipedia.org" into the Google search bar.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Interacting with Text Input Fields (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
    - **Identifying the Target:** Look for a rectangular area that looks like it's for text input. It might contain placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL", "Enter your name") or have a blinking cursor if already focused. The element you want to tap is the **text area itself**, not necessarily adjacent icons.
    - **Avoiding Adjacent Icons:** Input fields often have icons like a **Microphone (ðŸŽ¤)** for voice input or a **Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·)** icon. **Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.** Tapping them will activate unintended features and interrupt text input.
    - **The Correct Sequence for Text Input:**
    1.  `tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`: Tap the actual text input area to ensure it is focused and ready to receive keyboard input. **THIS IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP.**
    2.  `type_global("your desired text")`: Enter the text.
    3.  **Submitting (Crucial for Searches/Forms/URLs):** If the input was for a search, URL, or form field, you **MUST** submit it.
         -   The primary method is `press_enter()`.
         -   Alternatively, look for a dedicated "Search", "Go", "Submit", "Login", or similar button and `tap()` it.
         -   **An action like search or form submission is only complete after this submission step.** Typing alone is not enough. **FOR A URL, YOU MUST PRESS ENTER TO NAVIGATE.**
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
-        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
-        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
-        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
-        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models'. is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str)

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search results page displaying various links related to "wikipedia.org".  The top result is the plain "wikipedia.org" link. The task is to open wikipedia.org and search for "Large Language Models".  The previous action was to type "wikipedia.org" into the Google search bar.  Now, the goal is to select the top search result to open Wikipedia, and then perform a search within Wikipedia.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to open the Wikipedia homepage. Element 51 (the top search result) represents the "wikipedia.org" link.  Tapping this element will navigate to the Wikipedia homepage.

Action: tap(51)

Summary: Tapped the top search result link to open wikipedia.org.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a list of search results, primarily related to wikipedia.org. The top result is "wikipedia.org" (element 50).  The objective is to open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models'.  The previous action successfully opened wikipedia.org.  The current screen is the wikipedia.org main page.  There is a search bar visible, with UI elements at the bottom of the screen (elements 38 & 39 appear to be a microphone and a close button).

Thought: The next step is to perform a search for "Large Language Models" on the wikipedia.org page. This requires interacting with the search bar. The elements at the bottom of the screen (38 & 39) are not the text input field, but rather a microphone and the 'close' button. I need to identify the search bar element and use the type_global function to enter the search term, followed by pressing enter. I'll need to visually identify the search bar. Assuming the search bar is visible, it's likely the primary area to enter text.

Action: type_global("Large Language Models")

Summary: Typed "Large Language Models" into the Wikipedia search bar.

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search results page on a smartphone. The search query "wikipedia.orgLarge Language Models" is displayed prominently at the top.  Below are several search suggestions related to "Large Language Models" and Wikipedia. The numbered UI elements 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 are various elements on the screen; I assume element 23 is one of the search suggestions. The goal is to open wikipedia.org and search for 'Large Language Models', which seems to already be partially accomplished (the query is typed) but needs to be submitted to open the page. Element 23 seems to be a suitable candidate to tap in order to open wikipedia.org.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to select one of the search results to open the Wikipedia page for "Large Language Models".  Since the search query is already present, I will select the search suggestion. Element 23 seems to be the top suggestion, so tapping it will likely open the Wikipedia page.

Action: tap(23)

Summary: Tapped the top search suggestion in the Google search results to open the Wikipedia page for "Large Language Models".

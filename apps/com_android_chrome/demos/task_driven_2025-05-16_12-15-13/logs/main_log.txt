--- Round 1 (TASK Mode) ---
Prompt:
You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags.
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. Your current objective: Task: Open wikipedia.org and search for "Large Language Models".
4. A summary of your previous action: App launched.
5. For exploration mode, a list of features/areas already explored:
   N/A (This will be "N/A" if not in exploration mode)

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action TO ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- **Handling Pop-ups, Dialogs, and Unexpected Interruptions (e.g., Permission Requests, Error Messages):**
    - **Primary Goal:** Dismiss the interruption to return to your main task, unless the pop-up is essential for your current objective (e.g., a login prompt).
    - **Google Search Bar Voice Issues:** If you intended to type in the Google Search bar but a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appeared:
        1.  Dismiss the voice error ( using `press_back()`).
        2.  **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
        3.  Then use `type_global()`.
        4.  Finally, `press_enter()` to submit the search or URL.
    - **Dismissal Strategy (Prioritized):**
        1.  Look for "No", "Cancel", "Dismiss", "Close", or an "X" icon/button. If found, `tap()` it.
        2.  If the above are not present, and the pop-up is clearly an error message or an unwanted interruption (like a voice search error when you intended text input), the safest general way to try and dismiss it is `press_back()`. **AVOID tapping "Try again" or similar options on error pop-ups unless you intend to retry the failed operation (e.g., a genuine voice search attempt that failed).**
        3.  If it's a necessary permission request (e.g., app needs location to show nearby places and your task requires it) or a simple confirmation, then `tap()` the affirmative option ("Allow", "OK", "Yes", "Only this time").
    - **Observe:** After attempting dismissal, check if the pop-up is gone.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.
Thought: Now I will type the URL.
Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

**AVOID TAPPING ADJACENT ICONS:**
Input fields often have icons like a Microphone (ðŸŽ¤) or Camera/Lens (ðŸ“·).
**Unless the task *explicitly* requires voice input or using the camera/lens feature, AVOID tapping these icons.**
Focus on tapping the main text area.
If a voice prompt (like "Didn't catch that") appears unexpectedly after you tried to type or press enter, it means you likely didn't tap the text field correctly first, or the field wasn't focused for keyboard input. In this case:
    1. Dismiss the voice error (e.g., `press_back()` or tapping a "Try again" / "Cancel" button).
    2. **Crucially, `tap()` the main text area of the search bar again.**
    3. Re-attempt `type_global()`.
    4. `press_enter()`.

- **Avoiding Repetitive Ineffective Actions:**
    - **If an action was judged "INEFFECTIVE" by reflection (UI didn't change as expected) or "CONTINUE" (but didn't achieve the sub-goal), DO NOT immediately repeat the exact same action on the exact same element.**
    - **Re-evaluate:** Why did it fail? Did you tap an icon instead of a text field? Was a pop-up present? Did you forget to `press_enter()`? Is the element not what you thought?
    - **Try a different approach:** Tap a different part of the target element, try a different element, or use `press_back()` if stuck.

- Finding and Opening Apps: (Less relevant if app is launched directly, but kept for VLM's general knowledge)
    # ... (previous content for this hint) ...

- Element Not Visible (General Scrolling): If a target UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")`.
- Adding New Items / Creating Content: Look for "+" icons, or "Add", "New", "Create" buttons.
- Closing an App: Use `press_app_switch()`, then `swipe_element(app_card_number, "up", "medium")` or tap a "Clear all" button.
- Notifications: Use `open_notifications()` to open, and `close_notifications()` or `press_back()` to close.
- General Navigation: `press_back()` for previous screen, `press_home()` for home screen.
- Task Completion: If your current objective Task: Open wikipedia.org and search for "Large Language Models". is fully achieved, use `FINISH`.
**MANDATORY Sequence for Text Input (e.g., Search Bars, URL Bars, Form Fields):**
Failure to follow this sequence will likely lead to errors or unintended behavior.

1.  **`tap(element_number_of_text_input_area)`:**
    *   **ALWAYS** tap the specific text input area first.
    *   This ensures the field is focused and the keyboard is ready for text.
    *   Look for rectangular areas, placeholder text (e.g., "Search...", "Type URL"), or a blinking cursor.
    *   **DO NOT skip this step.**

2.  **`type_global("your desired text")`: **
    *   After tapping, use this to enter your text.

3.  **`press_enter()` (for URLs and Searches) or `tap(submit_button_element_number)` (for Forms):**
    *   **IMMEDIATELY AFTER TYPING** a URL or a search query, you **MUST** use `press_enter()` to submit it. This action navigates to the URL or performs the search.
    *   For forms, look for a "Submit", "Login", "Go", "Search" button and `tap()` its element number.
    *   **Typing alone is INSUFFICIENT. Submission is required to proceed.**

*Example for opening a website:*
Thought: I need to open example.com. The search bar is element 3.
Action: tap(3)
Summary: Tapped the search bar.

Action: type_global("example.com")
Summary: Typed "example.com" into the search bar.
Thought: Now I must press enter to navigate to the website.
Action: press_enter()
Summary: Pressed enter to navigate to example.com.

    4. `press_enter()`.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str)
3.  long_press(element: int)

12. press_app_switch()
13. grid()
14. FINISH

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal to achieve the overall task? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target of this specific action? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response:
Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search results page for the query "wikipedia large language models".  The top result is a Wikipedia article link. The URL of the Wikipedia article is visible.  The screen is relevant to the objective because it displays the search results, including the Wikipedia page for "Large Language Models", which is the target of the task. Element 7 appears to be a link to the wikipedia article "Large Language Models."


Thought:The immediate sub-goal is to open the Wikipedia article. The most appropriate function is tap(7) because element 7 is the link to the Wikipedia page.


Action: tap(7)

Summary:Tapped the Wikipedia article link for "Large Language Models".

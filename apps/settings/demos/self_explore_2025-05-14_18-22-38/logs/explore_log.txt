Round 1 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone to complete a specific task.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags (center of the element).
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available from past interactions:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. The overall task to complete: Open the Settings app, navigate to Network & internet, then go back to the home screen.
4. A summary of your previous action: None

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- App/Element Not Visible: If the target app or UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")` to scroll or find an app drawer.
- Adding New Items: Look for UI elements like a plus sign (`+`) or text like "Add", "New", "Create". Use `tap(element_number)` on it.
- Editing Text Fields:
    1. `tap(element_number_of_field)` to focus the field.
    2. Use `press_delete()` repeatedly to clear existing unwanted text.
    3. Use `type_global("your new text")` to input the desired text.
- Closing an App:
    1. `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps.
    2. On the recent apps screen, identify the app's card (it will be labeled with a number).
    3. Use `swipe_element(element_number_of_app_card, "up", "medium")` to close it. Or, look for a "Clear all" button and `tap` it.
- Opening Notifications: Use `open_notifications()`. If it fails, you can try `swipe_screen("down", "short")` as a general gesture (though it swipes from screen center by default).
- General Navigation: Use `press_back()` to go to the previous screen. Use `press_home()` to go to the home screen.
- Performing Searches:
    1. `tap(element_number_of_search_field)` to focus.
    2. `type_global("your search query")`.
    3. To submit the exact typed query, use `press_enter()`.
    4. Alternatively, if relevant search suggestions appear and one is a better fit, you can `tap(element_number_of_suggestion)`. Prioritize `press_enter()` if your typed query is precise.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: tap(5)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str): Type text into the currently focused input field. Ensure field is focused first (e.g., via tap).
    Example: type_global("Hello world")
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: long_press(3)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a specific labeled UI element (e.g., a scrollable list).
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"].
    Example: swipe_element(2, "up", "medium")
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the entire screen generally. Useful for scrolling pages or app drawers.
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"] (e.g., short ~25% of screen, medium ~50%, long ~75%).
    Example: swipe_screen("down", "long")
6.  press_back(): Press the Android system Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android system Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Enter/Go key (usually on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Delete/Backspace key.
10. open_notifications(): Attempt to open the notification shade.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps overview.
12. grid(): If the target UI element is not labeled or labels are unhelpful, call this to switch to a grid-based interaction mode for the next step.
13. FINISH: Call this if you believe the task Open the Settings app, navigate to Network & internet, then go back to the home screen. is fully completed.

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows a search results page, likely from a search engine app. The top shows a search bar with "telugu movies 2024 full movie hindi" as the search query.  Below are several search results listed. There are no visible icons or elements related to the Settings app or Network & internet settings.  The screen is irrelevant to the task.

Thought: The current screen is a search results page, not related to the task of opening the Settings app.  To proceed, I need to go to the home screen first. The most direct way to achieve this is by using the press_home() function.

Action: press_home()

Summary: Pressed the home button to go to the home screen.

Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows the "Network & internet" settings page.  The previous action successfully navigated to this screen.  Element 11 is a back button.  The task is to go back to the home screen.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to return to the home screen from the Network & internet settings. The provided documentation and the image show the back button (Element 11), which is the most efficient way to return to the previous screen (Settings main page), and then pressing the home button to get to the home screen.

Action: press_home()

Summary: Navigated to the home screen.

Round 6 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone to complete a specific task.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags (center of the element).
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available from past interactions:
   No documentation available for elements on this screen.
3. The overall task to complete: Open the Settings app, navigate to Network & internet, then go back to the home screen.
4. A summary of your previous action: Navigated to the home screen.

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- App/Element Not Visible: If the target app or UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")` to scroll or find an app drawer.
- Adding New Items: Look for UI elements like a plus sign (`+`) or text like "Add", "New", "Create". Use `tap(element_number)` on it.
- Editing Text Fields:
    1. `tap(element_number_of_field)` to focus the field.
    2. Use `press_delete()` repeatedly to clear existing unwanted text.
    3. Use `type_global("your new text")` to input the desired text.
- Closing an App:
    1. `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps.
    2. On the recent apps screen, identify the app's card (it will be labeled with a number).
    3. Use `swipe_element(element_number_of_app_card, "up", "medium")` to close it. Or, look for a "Clear all" button and `tap` it.
- Opening Notifications: Use `open_notifications()`. If it fails, you can try `swipe_screen("down", "short")` as a general gesture (though it swipes from screen center by default).
- General Navigation: Use `press_back()` to go to the previous screen. Use `press_home()` to go to the home screen.
- Performing Searches:
    1. `tap(element_number_of_search_field)` to focus.
    2. `type_global("your search query")`.
    3. To submit the exact typed query, use `press_enter()`.
    4. Alternatively, if relevant search suggestions appear and one is a better fit, you can `tap(element_number_of_suggestion)`. Prioritize `press_enter()` if your typed query is precise.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: tap(5)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str): Type text into the currently focused input field. Ensure field is focused first (e.g., via tap).
    Example: type_global("Hello world")
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: long_press(3)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a specific labeled UI element (e.g., a scrollable list).
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"].
    Example: swipe_element(2, "up", "medium")
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the entire screen generally. Useful for scrolling pages or app drawers.
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"] (e.g., short ~25% of screen, medium ~50%, long ~75%).
    Example: swipe_screen("down", "long")
6.  press_back(): Press the Android system Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android system Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Enter/Go key (usually on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Delete/Backspace key.
10. open_notifications(): Attempt to open the notification shade.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps overview.
12. grid(): If the target UI element is not labeled or labels are unhelpful, call this to switch to a grid-based interaction mode for the next step.
13. FINISH: Call this if you believe the task Open the Settings app, navigate to Network & internet, then go back to the home screen. is fully completed.

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>

Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows the home screen of an Android smartphone.  Several app icons are visible, including Play Store (16), Gmail (17), Photos (18), YouTube (19), Phone (20), Messages (21), Chrome (22), and Google (24).  The app drawer is not currently visible. The task is to open the Settings app, navigate to Network & internet, then return to the home screen.  The Settings app icon is not directly visible on this screen.

Thought: The Settings app is not visible on the current home screen. To proceed, I need to find the Settings app.  Since it's not readily apparent, I will try swiping up to see if it's in the app drawer or on a different home screen page.  The most appropriate function is `swipe_screen("up", "medium")`.

Action: swipe_screen("up", "medium")

Summary: Swiped the screen upwards to reveal more apps.

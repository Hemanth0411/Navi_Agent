Round 1 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an agent controlling an Android device to complete a task. You are given the current UI screenshot with elements labeled with numbers, the overall task description, and a summary of your last action. First, provide your observation of the current UI and your thought process to decide the next action. Then, choose one of the following actions:

Hints:
- If the target application or UI elements needed for the task are not visible on the current screen (e.g., you are on the home screen and need a specific app), consider actions like `swipe_screen('up', 'medium')` or `swipe_screen('down', 'medium')` to find an app drawer or scroll for more options. Then, observe the new screen to locate the target.
- When you need to add a new item (like a task, list item, alarm, contact, event, etc.), look for a UI element that visually resembles a plus sign (`+`), or has text like "Add", "New", or "Create". This is commonly used for creation actions.
- When you need to change or edit existing text or numbers in a field: first, ensure the field is focused (you might need to `tap` it). Then, to clear or modify it, try to position the cursor at the end of the existing content (this might happen automatically on focus, or you might need to tap at the end of the text if possible). After that, use `press_delete()` repeatedly to remove the unwanted characters before typing new content with `type_text('new_value')`.
- To close an application completely: first, perform `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps. Then, on the recent apps screen, observe the layout. You might need to `swipe_element(element_representing_the_app_to_close, 'up', 'medium')` to close a specific app. Alternatively, look for a "Clear all" or similar button, which might require swiping through the recent apps list (e.g., using `swipe_screen('left', 'short')` or `swipe_screen('right', 'short')` repeatedly) to find it, then `tap` it.
- To open notifications: you can use the `open_notifications()` function directly. Alternatively, if that function seems ineffective or you prefer a gesture, you can try `swipe_screen('down', 'short')` starting from the very top of the screen (though `swipe_screen` usually swipes from center; this gesture might need a more precise swipe if the function fails).

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap a UI element with the given number.
2.  type_text(text_input: str): Input text into a focused text field. Make sure to tap on the text field first to focus it if needed, then use this action.
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press a UI element with the given number.
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a UI element with the given number. `direction` can be one of [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be one of [`short`, `medium`, `long`].
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the screen in a general direction. `direction` can be [`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`]. `distance` can be [`short`, `medium`, `long`] (controls swipe length relative to screen size, e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 of screen dimension).
6.  press_back(): Press the Android Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Android Enter/Go button (often on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Android Delete/Backspace button.
10. open_notifications(): Open the notification shade using a system command.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps screen.
12. FINISH: If you believe the task is completed.

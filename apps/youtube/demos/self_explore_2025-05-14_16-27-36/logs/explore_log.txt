Round 1 Explore Phase:
Prompt: You are an intelligent agent controlling a smartphone to complete a specific task.
You will be given:
1. The current smartphone screenshot with interactive UI elements labeled with numeric tags (center of the element).
2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available from past interactions:
   Element 10 (UID: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_hotseat.com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_search_container_hotseat_Googlesearch): Activates the Google search bar, allowing the user to input a search query.
Element 23 (UID: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_hotseat.com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_search_container_hotseat_Googlesearch): Activates the Google search bar, allowing the user to input a search query.

3. The overall task to complete: search for telugu movie
4. A summary of your previous action: None

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- App/Element Not Visible: If the target app or UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")` to scroll or find an app drawer.
- Adding New Items: Look for UI elements like a plus sign (`+`) or text like "Add", "New", "Create". Use `tap(element_number)` on it.
- Editing Text Fields:
    1. `tap(element_number_of_field)` to focus the field.
    2. Use `press_delete()` repeatedly to clear existing unwanted text.
    3. Use `type_global("your new text")` to input the desired text.
- Closing an App:
    1. `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps.
    2. On the recent apps screen, identify the app's card (it will be labeled with a number).
    3. Use `swipe_element(element_number_of_app_card, "up", "medium")` to close it. Or, look for a "Clear all" button and `tap` it.
- Opening Notifications: Use `open_notifications()`. If it fails, you can try `swipe_screen("down", "short")` as a general gesture (though it swipes from screen center by default).
- General Navigation: Use `press_back()` to go to the previous screen. Use `press_home()` to go to the home screen.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: tap(5)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str): Type text into the currently focused input field. Ensure field is focused first (e.g., via tap).
    Example: type_global("Hello world")
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: long_press(3)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a specific labeled UI element (e.g., a scrollable list).
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"].
    Example: swipe_element(2, "up", "medium")
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the entire screen generally. Useful for scrolling pages or app drawers.
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"] (e.g., short ~25% of screen, medium ~50%, long ~75%).
    Example: swipe_screen("down", "long")
6.  press_back(): Press the Android system Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android system Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Enter/Go key (usually on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Delete/Backspace key.
10. open_notifications(): Attempt to open the notification shade.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps overview.
12. grid(): If the target UI element is not labeled or labels are unhelpful, call this to switch to a grid-based interaction mode for the next step.
13. FINISH: Call this if you believe the task search for telugu movie is fully completed.

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows the home screen of an Android smartphone.  The bottom of the screen contains a Google search bar (element 23).  The provided documentation confirms that element 23 activates the Google search bar.  This is relevant to the task of searching for "telugu movie".

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to activate the Google search bar.  The most appropriate function is `tap(23)` because it will directly activate the search bar, allowing for the next step of inputting the search query.

Action: tap(23)

Summary: Tapped the Google search bar.

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search results page.  The search bar is at the top, and below it are several search results listed as numbered items (20-35).  The task is to search for "telugu movie".  I previously tapped the Google search bar.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to type the search query "telugu movie" into the search bar.  The search bar should already be focused since I tapped it in the previous step.  Therefore, the most appropriate function is `type_global` with the argument "telugu movie".

Action: type_global("telugu movie")

Summary: Typed "telugu movie" into the Google search bar.

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows a Google search results page on a smartphone.  The search query "telugu movie" has been entered, and several search suggestions related to Telugu movies are displayed below.  The provided documentation indicates that elements 6 through 52 are all related to the search result list, but their individual functions aren't specified beyond that.

The next step is to initiate the search.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to trigger the search based on the input "telugu movie".  The most appropriate function is `press_enter()`, as this will submit the search query in the Google search bar. No specific element number is needed for this function.

Action: press_enter()

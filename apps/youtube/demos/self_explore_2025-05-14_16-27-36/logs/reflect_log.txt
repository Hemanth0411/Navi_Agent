Round 1 Reflect Phase:
Prompt: You are reflecting on an action performed by an Android agent.
The overall task is: search for telugu movie

Action Details:
- Action Type: tap (e.g., "tap", "type_global", "press_home", "swipe_screen")
- Element Involved: Element 23 (UID: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_hotseat.com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_search_container_hotseat_Googlesearch) (e.g., "element 5", "N/A" for global actions)
- Agent's Intended Summary for this action: Tapped the Google search bar.

You are given screenshots before and after this action.
Your goal is to:
1. Evaluate if the action was correct and helpful for the overall task.
2. If a specific UI element was involved (e.g., from tap, long_press, swipe_element), provide concise documentation for its function based on the observed change. (e.g., "Opens user profile", "Submits the form").

Decision Categories:
1.  BACK: The action led to an irrelevant page or error. The agent should go back.
2.  INEFFECTIVE: The action made no meaningful change or did not achieve the Tapped the Google search bar..
3.  CONTINUE: The action changed the UI, but not as intended by Tapped the Google search bar. OR it doesn't clearly help the search for telugu movie. The agent should try something else on the current screen (if BACK is not chosen).
4.  SUCCESS: The action successfully moved the search for telugu movie forward as intended by Tapped the Google search bar..

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Decision: <BACK, INEFFECTIVE, CONTINUE, or SUCCESS>

2. Documentation for some UI elements on this screen, if available from past interactions:
   Element 10 (UID: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_hotseat.com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher.id_search_container_hotseat_Googlesearch): Activates the Google search bar, allowing the user to input a search query.

Activates the Google search bar, displaying a search input field and recent searches.

3. The overall task to complete: search for telugu movie in youtube
4. A summary of your previous action: None

First, observe the screen and use any provided documentation.
Then, think step-by-step to decide the best next action.
Finally, choose ONE function from the "Available Functions" list.

General Hints for Common Scenarios:
- App/Element Not Visible: If the target app or UI element isn't on screen, try `swipe_screen("up", "medium")` or `swipe_screen("down", "medium")` to scroll or find an app drawer.
- Adding New Items: Look for UI elements like a plus sign (`+`) or text like "Add", "New", "Create". Use `tap(element_number)` on it.
- Editing Text Fields:
    1. `tap(element_number_of_field)` to focus the field.
    2. Use `press_delete()` repeatedly to clear existing unwanted text.
    3. Use `type_global("your new text")` to input the desired text.
- Closing an App:
    1. `press_app_switch()` to show recent apps.
    2. On the recent apps screen, identify the app's card (it will be labeled with a number).
    3. Use `swipe_element(element_number_of_app_card, "up", "medium")` to close it. Or, look for a "Clear all" button and `tap` it.
- Opening Notifications: Use `open_notifications()`. If it fails, you can try `swipe_screen("down", "short")` as a general gesture (though it swipes from screen center by default).
- General Navigation: Use `press_back()` to go to the previous screen. Use `press_home()` to go to the home screen.

Available Functions:
1.  tap(element: int): Tap the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: tap(5)
2.  type_global(text_to_input: str): Type text into the currently focused input field. Ensure field is focused first (e.g., via tap).
    Example: type_global("Hello world")
3.  long_press(element: int): Long press the UI element with the given numeric tag.
    Example: long_press(3)
4.  swipe_element(element: int, direction: str, distance: str): Swipe on a specific labeled UI element (e.g., a scrollable list).
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"].
    Example: swipe_element(2, "up", "medium")
5.  swipe_screen(direction: str, distance: str): Swipe the entire screen generally. Useful for scrolling pages or app drawers.
    `direction` must be one of ["up", "down", "left", "right"].
    `distance` must be one of ["short", "medium", "long"] (e.g., short ~25% of screen, medium ~50%, long ~75%).
    Example: swipe_screen("down", "long")
6.  press_back(): Press the Android system Back button.
7.  press_home(): Press the Android system Home button.
8.  press_enter(): Press the Enter/Go key (usually on a virtual keyboard).
9.  press_delete(): Press the Delete/Backspace key.
10. open_notifications(): Attempt to open the notification shade.
11. press_app_switch(): Show the recent apps overview.
12. grid(): If the target UI element is not labeled or labels are unhelpful, call this to switch to a grid-based interaction mode for the next step.
13. FINISH: Call this if you believe the task search for telugu movie in youtube is fully completed.

Output Format (Strictly follow this):
Observation: <Your detailed observation of the current screen, noting relevant UI elements, their labels, and any provided documentation. How does the screen relate to the task?>
Thought: <Your step-by-step reasoning. What is the immediate sub-goal? Which function is most appropriate and why? Which element (if any) is the target? What parameters are needed?>
Action: <The single function call you choose. Example: tap(1) or type_global("search query") or press_home() or FINISH>
Summary: <A brief human-readable summary of THE ACTION YOU JUST CHOSE. Example: "Tapped the settings icon.", "Typed 'pizza' into the search bar.", "Navigated to the home screen.">

Response: Observation: The screenshot shows the home screen of an Android smartphone.  The YouTube app (element 19) is visible.  The documentation describes element 23 as activating the Google search bar. Element 23 is visible at the bottom of the screen. The task is to search for "telugu movie" on YouTube.

Thought: The immediate sub-goal is to open the YouTube app.  I can achieve this by tapping the YouTube app icon.  After that, I'll need to use the YouTube search functionality within the app.

Action: tap(19)

Summary: Tapped the YouTube app icon.
